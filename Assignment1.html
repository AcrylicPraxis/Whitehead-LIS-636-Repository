    <a href="https://library.uncg.edu" alt="Link to the Jackson Libraray Website"
    title="Link to UNCG's Jackson Library Website" target=" blank">found here.</a>
<!-- Had problems making the alternate hover-over text show up for the link.
Was able to make it work with the "title" tag-->

    The header at the top indicates that the Jackson library subsists
    under the greater umbrella of the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.
    It also has links to different websites that visitors may find useful.
    Under the header is a large search box that allows for easy searching
    for any item. There are links for:
    <ul>
      <li> Advanced Searches </li>
      <li> Databases </li>
      <li> Journal Lists </li>
      <li> Research Guides </li>
      <li> Course Reserves </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    To the right of the search box is another box offering aid to the
    online patron. The services it offers are options to chat with a
    librarian, research help, and assistance with locating an item.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below these boxes is a bar with four links with drop-down menus
    offering information on the libraries and collections, services,
    spaces, and an about page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next on the page is a large box detail reservations.
    From this box you can reserve rooms, equipment, or technology.

    alt="Screenshot of the Reservation Box" title="The Reservation Box"><!--Zack: This link was over specific and wasn't working on my computer. A more truncated link is probably of value here, as it lets the browser do mroe of the resolution in finding the resoruce.-->
  </p>
  <p>
    The next section down is broken into 3 boxes from left to right.
    The left most box is a spotlight section that highlights items of interest,
    the middle section is about blogs and social media,
    and the right box is for news and library events.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below those three boxes is a list of other links that patrons
    might find useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, there is an anchor that contains the contact info,
    address, and logo of UNCG.
  </p><!--Zack: The Extensive listing of compotents is probably more than I needed. -->
  <br />
  <p>
    The pages are primarily designed for use by students.
    Being a student, this is a highly helpful page as it is the hub
    for the whole of the digital library. However, I am a distance learner,
    so I don’t have any need for most of the links on the page that have
    to do with reserving equipment or spaces. The most used section by far
    is the search option, which allows me to look through the digital stacks
    in search of any information or resources that I may need.
    I have also used the “talk to a librarian” function, which is very useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website was designed primarily for the on-campus user,
    but it retains a lot of functionality for distance learners.
    The components of this website contain everything that I have
    needed so far in my program. <!--Zack: These last two paragraphs are what I was looking for. I appreciate the work above, but put more time into this! -->

<!--I am unsure of how to make text wrap around so the page
isnt so wide and just looks more put together.--><!-- Zack: CSS and styling. The brutality of the raw html is part of the point of the assignment.-->
